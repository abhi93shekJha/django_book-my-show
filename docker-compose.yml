version: "3.9"   # version of docker compose syntax, if they release a new version, it won't break our services

services:
  app:   # this is the name of our service that will build docker file
    build:
      context: .   # when building using the root directory (where dockerfile is present which we are building)
      args:
        - DEV=true   # DEV variable will be used inside dockerfile, before building we are setting it to true
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"    # maps port 8000 on our local machine to port 8000 in docker container. Now we can make API calls from host machine, since 8000 on localhost is active.
    volumes:
      - ./book_my_show:/app   # used for mapping directories from our system to docker container, /app here is inside of docker container
                # any code changes to local, will reflect in /app inside docker in real time, no need to rebuild everytime
                # also any data created inside /app inside container will persist in local inside './book_my_show'
    command: >   # we can specify the command that will be used when we run docker compose by docker-compose run, this can be overridden by sepecifying the command with docker-compose run
